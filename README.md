# Continuous Testing In Production
I did some investigations on continuous testing in production and I found an awesome easy method.

This ultimately catapults you out of the stone age of quality assurance.

All used tools are for free! I reuse my existing environments, so no I have no additional costs at all (maybe, but not noticeable).

This is not for coders only. Think about testing your shop checkout workflow, youe internet portal, on premise GitLab hosting or project management tools. The sky is the limit.

No new or special infrastructure is required. Docker or Kubernetes is welcome, but not required. From scratch set up can be done in minutes.

All my test cases from the build pipeline can be reused, without any modifications.

All inclusive: Detection of infrastructure, configuration problems, overload situations, performance bottlenecks, ...

Unit tests, GUI test and API tests are running the whole day now. Why not?

Getting the test failure alarms on the mobile phone reduces the reaction time to minutes.

I found no article on the internet doing it this easy way.
